Heterogeneous grouping seating chart and gradebook
The idea here is to be able to design a quick seating chart program for classroom teachers.  Teachers will export from their gradebooks student competencies, rated on a 5-point scale.  From these values, it is desirable to run a function that will seat students strong in one area with students weak in another, and vice versa.  This way a well balanced skillset is at every table.  This tool should allow for teachers to revise every unit, wherein different skills may be required, and as a result different balances of students will result.  
Because gradebook software varies school to school, the fucntionality has to be on the heterogeneous grouping end to allow for access agnostic of school program selection.
